This is an app where people who are not able to communicate with each other would be able to. Imagine you traveling or you are talking to someone who can't read very well. This app would allow you to Video chat as well as have live translation with Gifs as support.

For Technical Aspects we used:

Ionic Framework : This is so that the app can be deployed in all platforms , from Android to IOS. Google API and Cloud Platform: This is to use their NLP technology and to translate in different language. GfyCat API : This is used to help search their databases to get different GIFs as well as display it in the app Djanjo + Flask : This is to help do many of the backend using Python.

For Design:

We used Google's Material Design principle and used bold color scheme. We went with the minimalistic approach to ensure the design is easy for anyone to use.
